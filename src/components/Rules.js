        <b>The Game</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Hangman is a classic word game in which you must guess the secret word
        one letter at a time. Challenge friends from Facebook, Twitter, Google+
        or The Free Dictionary, or go up against random opponents across all
        platforms. Guess one letter at a time to reveal the secret word.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each incorrect guess adds another part to the hangman. You only get 7
        incorrect guesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rack up more points than your opponent after 3 rounds to win the game!
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>The Points</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can score up to 10 points for each correct word. Points are
        subtracted for each incorrect guess. If you get 2 correct answers in a
        row, you'll get 2x the points (up to 20 points) for the second word. For
        3 or more consecutive words, you'll get 3x the points (up to 30 points)
        for each word. Try to keep your streak going!
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>The Words</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can look up your answers in the dictionary at the end of each round.
        Clicking on a word will take you to TheFreeDictionary.com, or to The
        Free Dictionary mobile app if you have it installed. Download the app
        from the App Store, Google Play, or Windows Phone Store to bookmark your
        favorite WordHub answers or share interesting new words with your
        friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Hints</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        If you need help finding a word, click the Hint button (or press Alt+L
        on your keyboard).
      </p>
      <p>Each hint costs 1 coin and will give you 1 letter.</p>
      <p>
        If you start a round with fewer than 10 hints and you use them all, you
        can get more coins to redeem for hints during the round by clicking the
        Hint button.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you start a round with no hints (i.e. you have no coins), you will
        not be able to get more during the round, so stock up before each round!
      </p>
      <p>
        After each round, you can see which letters were found using hints by
        both you and your opponent.
