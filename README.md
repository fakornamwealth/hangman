## Description

Hangman is a classic word game in which you must guess the secret word \
one letter at a time. Challenge friends from Facebook, Twitter, Google+ \
or The Free Dictionary, or go up against random opponents across all \
platforms.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to play

Guess one letter at a time to reveal the secret word.

Each incorrect guess adds another part to the hangman. You only get 7 \
incorrect guesses.
